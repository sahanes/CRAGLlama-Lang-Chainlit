# LlamaCRAGChain

A project integrating LlamaIndex workflows with Corrective RAG (CRAG) for advanced relevancy management, evolving from a basic Chainlit UI to a complex ReAct LangGraph system.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: CRAG-Chainlit Integration
- LlamaIndex workflows with CRAG for relevancy management
- Chainlit user interface
- Basic interaction model

### Phase 2: CRAG-ReAct-LangGraph Enhancement
- LlamaIndex workflows with CRAG (continued from Phase 1)
- Integration of ReAct paradigm
- Implementation of LangGraph for complex workflow management
- Advanced, dynamic user interaction model

## Consistent Features Across Phases
- LlamaIndex as the core framework
- CRAG (Corrective RAG) for relevancy management
- Chainlit for user interface
- Production-ready optimizations (session handling, prompt caching)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+

## Installation
```bash
pip install chainlit
